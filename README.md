🚀 Objective
To strengthen understanding of StatefulWidget and how the setState() method works in Flutter by building a dynamic and interactive UI.

🧠 Concept
This isn’t just a simple counter — it’s a counter with personality!
Each time the increment button is tapped, the UI changes in a meaningful and visually engaging way using setState().

🎨 Features
We’ve added creative twists to the traditional counter:

✅ Emoji Mood Counter – Displays different emojis based on the current count

✅ Color Change Counter – The background color changes randomly with each button press.

✅ Font Size Grower – The emoji's font size increases as the counter increases for added fun.
